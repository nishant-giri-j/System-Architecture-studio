AVAILABLE PROTOCOLS (PREFER THESE):

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

ARCHITECTURAL RULES (STRICTLY ENFORCED — violating these produces broken designs):
1. Clients CANNOT connect directly to databases or caches — always route through services
2. Databases CANNOT initiate outbound requests — they only reply
3. Caches CANNOT initiate requests to clients
4. Network components (load balancers) CANNOT connect directly to databases — route through services
5. Message queues CANNOT connect directly to databases — a worker/consumer service must sit between
6. Always place load balancers or API gateways between clients and backend services
7. Every node MUST be connected — no orphan nodes

LOGIC STEP RULES (CRITICAL — this defines what each node ACTUALLY DOES):
Every node MUST have logicSteps that model its REAL-WORLD behavior. When an intermediary node calls a downstream dependency, it MUST explicitly handle the response back.

• Load Balancer / API Gateway:
  - forward(always) → downstream service(s)
  - reply(on-success) — pass successful responses back up to client
  - reply(on-error) — pass errors back up to client
  - MUST set routingStrategy to "load-balance"

• Application Service / Microservice:
  - forward(always) → downstream dependencies (cache, DB, queue)
  - reply(on-success) — pass successful responses back upstream
  - reply(on-error) — pass errors back upstream
  - MUST set routingStrategy to "broadcast" (default)

• Cache (Redis, Memcached, etc.):
  - simulate-cache with hitRate (70-95% is realistic)
  - reply(on-hit) — return cached data immediately
  - forward(on-miss) → the backing database
  - reply(on-success) — pass DB response back upstream

• Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.):
  - reply(always) — process query and return data

• Message Queue / Event Stream (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.):
  - forward(always) → consumer/worker service(s) for each subscriber

• CDN:
  - simulate-cache with hitRate (90-99%)
  - reply(on-hit) — serve from edge
  - forward(on-miss) → origin server
  - reply(on-success) — pass origin response back to client

• Auth Service:
  - forward(on-success) → downstream service
  - reply(on-error) — return 401/403 back to client

• Worker / Background Service:
  - forward(always) → result destination or reply(always)

IMPORTANT: targetNodeId in logicSteps MUST reference another node's id that this node connects to via an edge in your output.

REALISTIC LATENCY & PROCESSING DELAY RULES (CRITICAL):
You MUST fill in the \`latency\` object and \`processingDelay\` for EVERY node to mathematically model its physical behavior!
• processingDelay: Base milliseconds a node spends processing before routing/replying. (e.g. API Gateway=5ms, heavy ML model=1500ms, DB=15ms, Redis=1ms).
• latency.workload: Choose "light", "normal", or "heavy". (e.g. Analytics DB is "heavy", CDN is "light").
• latency.networkHops: Number of network jumps to reach this node (e.g. CDN=1, Internal DB=0).
• latency.concurrency: Multiplier for concurrent load (default 1).
• latency.nodeOverrideMs: Absolute latency floor minimum added delay in ms.
• latency.cacheHitRate: Global cache hit rate (0-100) for cache components.

WIRE / EDGE RULES:
• event = descriptive name of what travels on this wire (e.g., "HTTP GET /api/users", "order.created", "Cache Lookup user:123")
• protocol = communication protocol used (e.g., "REST", "gRPC", "Kafka", "WebSocket", "SQL", "Redis (RESP)")
• edgeStyle = "bezier" for synchronous connections, "step" for async/queue connections

NEW TECHNOLOGY FORMAT:
If you MUST use a technology not in the available list:
• id must be kebab-case (e.g., "scylladb")
• Include ALL 8 info fields with DETAILED, ACCURATE technical descriptions
• color should be the technology's brand color as hex

NEW PROTOCOL FORMAT:
If you MUST use a protocol not in the available list:
• Include ALL fields with accurate technical descriptions

OUTPUT QUALITY:
• Design for real-world production use — not toy examples
• Include proper error handling paths where appropriate (on-error conditions)
• Use realistic cache hit rates based on the use case
• Choose protocols that match real-world usage (REST for external APIs, gRPC for internal microservices, Kafka for event streaming, etc.)
• Every node must do REAL WORK — not just pass through`;
